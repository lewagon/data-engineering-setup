## Docker üêã

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.

### Install Docker and Docker Compose

Setup the dock apt repo

```bash
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```

```bash
echo \
  "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

Install the right packages

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

Finally give your user permission to use `docker`

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

Run `docker run hello-world`, you should see something like:

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'>‚ùóÔ∏è Permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket. ‚ùóÔ∏è </summary>

If you receive an error similar to the one below, navigate to the [GCP Compute Engine Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances) and shut down your VM by selecting the tick box next to your VM instance and clicking STOP (closing and reopening VSCode is not enough).

It will take a few minutes for your VM to turn off. Once it's fully off, turn your VM on again by checking the box next to the VM instance and clicking START. Give the VM a few minutes to fully start up and connect through VSCode. Once connected try `docker run hello-world` again. If you don't get an output similar to the below image, raise a ticket with a teacher.

### Enable Artifact Registry API

**üëå Note: Skip to the next section if you already have an Artifact Registry repository**

[Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry) is a GCP service you will use to store artifacts such as Docker images. The storage units are called repositories.

- Enable the service within your project using the `gcloud` CLI:
    ```bash
    gcloud services enable artifactregistry.googleapis.com
    ```
- Create a new Docker repository:
    ```bash
    # Set the repository name
    REPOSITORY=docker-hub
    # Set the location of the repository. Available locations: gcloud artifacts locations list
    LOCATION=europe-west1
    gcloud artifacts repositories create $REPOSITORY \
    --repository-format=docker \
    --location=$LOCATION \
    --description="Docker images storage"
    ```

### Gcloud authentication for Docker

You need to grant Docker access to push artifacts to (and pull from) your repository. There are different authentication methods, [gcloud credentials helper](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/authentication#gcloud-helper) being the easiest.

- Define the repository hostname matching the repository `$LOCATION`:
    ```bash
    # If $LOCATION is "europe-west1"
    HOSTNAME=europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev
    ```
- Configure gcloud credentials helper:
    ```bash
    gcloud auth configure-docker $HOSTNAME
    ```
- Type `y` to accept the configuration
- Check your credentials helper is set:
    ```bash
    cat ~/.docker/config.json
    ```
    You should get:
    ```bash
    {
      "credHelpers": {
        "europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev": "gcloud"
      }
    }%
    ```
