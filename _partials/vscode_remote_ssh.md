### VS Code Remote SSH Extension

We need to connect VS Code to a virtual machine in the cloud so you will only work on that machine during the bootcamp. A pretty useful [**Remote SSH Extension**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) is available on the VS Code Marketplace.

- Open VS Code > Open the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) > Type `Extensions: Install Extensions`

- Install the extension

That's the only extension you should install on your _local_ machine, we will install additional VS Code extensions on your _virtual machine_.
