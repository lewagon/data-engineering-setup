## Google Cloud CLI

Install the `gcloud` CLI to communicate with [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) through your terminal:
```bash
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg] https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt cloud-sdk main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates gnupg
curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg add -
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install google-cloud-sdk
sudo apt-get install google-cloud-sdk-app-engine-python
```

<!-- ### Create a service account key 🔑

**👌 Note: Skip to the next section if you already have a service account key**

Now that you have created a `GCP account` and a `project` (identified by its `PROJECT_ID`), we are going to configure the actions (API calls) that you want to allow your code to perform.

<details>
  <summary>🤔 Why do we need a service account key ?</summary>


  You have created a `GCP account` linked to your credit card. Your account will be billed according to your usage of the ressources of the **Google Cloud Platform**. The billing will occur if you consume anything once the free trial is over, or if you exceed the amount of spending allowed during the free trial.

  In your `GCP account`, you have created a single `GCP project`, identified by its `PROJECT_ID`. The `GCP projects` allow you to organize and monitor more precisely how you consume the **GCP** ressources. For the purpose of the bootcamp, we are only going to create a single project.

  Now, we need a way to tell which ressources within a `GCP project` our code will be allowed to consume. Our code consumes GCP ressources through API calls.

  Since API calls are not free, it is important to define with caution how our code will be allowed to use them. During the bootcamp this will not be an issue and we are going to allow our code to use all the API of **GCP** without any restrictions.

  In the same way that there may be several projects associated with a GCP account, a project may be composed of several services (any bundle of code, whatever its form factor, that requires the usage of GCP API calls in order to fulfill its purpose).

  GCP requires that the services of the projects using API calls are registered on the platform and their credentials configured through the access granted to a `service account`.

  For the moment we will only need to use a single service and will create the corresponding `service account`.

Since the [service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts) is what identifies your application (and therefore your GCP billing account and ultimately your credit card), you are going to want to be cautious with the next steps.

⚠️ **Do not share you service account json file 🔑** ⚠️ Do not store it on your desktop, do not store it in your git codebase (even if your git repository is private), do not let it by the coffee machine, do not send it as a tweet.

- Go to the [service accounts page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey)
- Select your project in the list of recent projects if asked to
- Create a service account:
  - Click on **CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT**:
  - Give a `Service account name` to that account
  - Click on **CREATE AND CONTINUE**
  - Click on **Select a role** and choose `Quick access/Basic` then **Owner**, which gives full access to all ressources
  - Click on **CONTINUE**
  - Click on **DONE**
- Download the service account json file 🔑:
  - Click on the newly created service account
  - Click on **KEYS**
  - Click on **ADD KEY** then **Create new key**
  - Select **JSON** and click on **CREATE**

The browser has now saved the service account json file 🔑 in your downloads directory (it is named according to your service account name, something like `le-wagon-data-123456789abc.json`) -->
