## Dotfiles

Let's pimp your zsh and and vscode by installing lewagon recommanded dotfiles **on your Virtual Machine**

There are three options, choose **one**:

        <strong>I already attended Web-Dev or Data-Science bootcamp at Le Wagon <em>ðŸš¨ on the same Virtual Machine (highly unlikely!ðŸš¨)</em></strong>
    </summary>

This means that you already forked the GitHub repo `lewagon/dotfiles`, but at that time the configuration was maybe not ready for the new Data Science bootcamp.

Open your terminal and go to your `dotfiles` project:

```bash
cd ~/code/<YOUR_GITHUB_NICKNAME>/dotfiles
<CODE_EDITOR_CMD> . # Open it in <CODE_EDITOR>
```

In <CODE_EDITOR>, open the `zshrc` file. Replace its content with the [newest version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/dotfiles/master/zshrc) of that file that we provide. Save to disk.

Back to the terminal, run a `git diff` and ask a TA to come and check about this configuration change. You should see stuff about Python and `pyenv`.

Once this is good, commit and push your changes:

```bash
git add zshrc
git commit -m "Update zshrc for Data Engineering bootcamp"
git push origin master
```
