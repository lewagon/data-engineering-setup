## Terraform

Terraform is a tool for infrastructure as code (IAC) to create (and destroy) resources to create in the cloud.

$MAC_START
You can use `brew` to install terraform. In your terminal, run:

```bash
brew tap hashicorp/tap
brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform
```
$MAC_END
$WINDOWS_START
### Download

To install terraform, download the **zip archive** from the Terraform install page at this [link here üîó](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install).

‚ùó If you are using Windows 10 or 11, download the **AMD64** version (64 bit version).

1. Using file explorer to go to the location you downloaded the **terraform zip archive**

2. **Unzip** the archive and two files should appear: `terraform.exe` and `license.txt`.

3. Copy `terraform.exe`

4. Navigate to your home directory (`C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\`) and create a directory named **cli_apps**

5. Paste `terraform.exe` in the **cli_apps** directory

### Add terraform to PATH

We need to manually add **Terraform** to the `PATH` environment variable. The `PATH` variable contains a list of directories that your computer looks in for programs that we run from the command prompt.

To update your path:
1. Open Windows Search and search for: **Environment Variables**

2. Click **Environment Variables** or **Edit environment variables for your account**

3. Click **New** on to top right of this window

4. Enter: `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\cli_apps` - Make sure to replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your computers user name.

5. Click **Ok** to close the `Path` variable window, and click **Ok** again to close the Environment Variable window.

6. Close **Command Prompt** and open it again
$WINDOWS_END
$LINUX_START
Install some basic requirements:
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common
```

Terraform is not available to **apt** by default, so we need to manually add the repository.
```bash
wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | \
    gpg --dearmor | \
    sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null
```

```bash
gpg --no-default-keyring \
    --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg \
    --fingerprint
```

```bash
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] \
    https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
```

Now we can install terraform directly with **apt** üëá
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install terraform
```
$LINUX_END

Verify the installation with:

```bash
terraform --version
```
