## Let's Make!

Lets clone the challenges onto your **virtual machine**

```bash
export GITHUB_USERNAME=`gh api user | jq -r '.login'`
echo $GITHUB_USERNAME
```

Then

```bash
mkdir -p ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME && cd $_
gh repo fork lewagon/data-engineering-challenges --clone
```
You want this setup:

Check your remotes match `origin` your data engineering challenges and `upstream` lewagon's!
```bash
cd data-engineering-challenges
git remote -v
# origin          git@github.com:your_github_username/data-engineering-challenges.git (fetch)
# origin          git@github.com:your_github_username/data-engineering-challenges.git (push)
# upstream        git@github.com:lewagon/data-engineering-challenges.git (fetch)
# upstream        git@github.com:lewagon/data-engineering-challenges.git (push)
```

From challenge folder root **on the vm**, we'll run `make install`, which triggers 3 operations:

- `make install-poetry`: `cd` inside each challenge folders, and `poetry install` inside each! (takes a while)
- `make allow-envrc`: allow direnv to execute inside each folder (otherwise you have to manually "allow" it)
- `make own-repo`: allows your user to be the linux "owner" of all files in this challenge folder

Let's make! (You've got time for a coffee ☕️, or start next step during the install)

```bash
make install
```

⚠️ If at the very end of this process you get 3-4 errors like: `direnv: error .envrc file not found` - that is normal and nothing to worry about.
