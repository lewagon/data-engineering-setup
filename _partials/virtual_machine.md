## Virtual Machine (VM)

**ðŸ‘Œ Note: Skip to the next section if you already have a VM set up**

_Note: The following section requires you already have a [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) account associated with an active [Billing account](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing)._

- Go to console.cloud.google.com > > Compute Engine > VM instances > Create instance
- Name it `lewagon-data-eng-vm-<github_username>`, replace `<github_username>` with your own, e.g. `krokrob`
- Region `europe-west1`, choose the closest one among the [available regions](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones#available)

- In the section `Machine configuration` under the sub-heading `Machine type`
- Select General purpose > PRESET > e2-standard-4

    <img alt="gcloud-console-vm-e2-standard4" src="https://wagon-public-assets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/v9dv42llst8qjp2uj0d1yr00po1g" width=500>
- Boot disk > Change
  - Operating system > Ubuntu
  - Version > Ubuntu 22.04 LTS x86/64
  - Boot disk type > Balanced persistent disk
  - Size > upgrade to 150GB

- Open `Networking, Disks, ...` under `Advanced options`
- Open `Networking`

    <img alt="gcloud-console-vm-networking" src="https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/data-engineering/setup/gcloud-console-vm-networking.png" width=500>
- Go to `Network interfaces` and click on `default default (...)` with a downward arrow on the right.

    <img alt="gcloud-console-vm-network-interfaces" src="https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/data-engineering/setup/gcloud-console-vm-network-interfaces.png" width=500>
- This opened a box `Edit network interface`
- Go to the dropdown `External IPv4 address`, click on it, click on `RESERVE STATIC EXTERNAL IP ADDRESS`

    <img alt="gcloud-console-vm-create-static-ip" src="https://wagon-public-assets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/1ax09j2zld7x0lsvpp9p8ld8u5vc" width=300>
- Give it a name, like "lewagon-data-eng-vm-ip-<github_username>" (replace `<github_username>` with your own) and description "Le Wagon - Data Engineering VM IP". This will take a few seconds.

- You will now have a public IP associated with your account, and later to your VM instance. Click on `Done` at the bottom of the section `Edit network interface` you were in.

### Public SSH key
- Open the `Security` section

    <img alt="gcloud-console-vm-security" src="https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/data-engineering/setup/gcloud-console-vm-security.png" width=300>
- Open the `Manage access` subsection

    <img alt="gcloud-console-manage-access" src="https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/data-engineering/setup/gcloud-console-manage-access.png" width=200>
- Go to `Add manually generated SSH keys` and click `Add item`

    <img alt="gcloud-console-add-manual-ssh-key" src="https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/data-engineering/setup/gcloud-console-add-manual-ssh-key.png" width=500>
- In your terminal display your public SSH key:
    - Windows: navigate to where you created your SSH key and open `id_ed25519.pub`

    - Mac/Linux users can use:
        ```bash
        cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
        # OR cat ~/.ssh/de-bootcamp.pub if you created a unique key
        ```
- Copy your public SSH key and paste it:

- On the right hand side you should see

    <img alt="gcloud-console-vm-price-month" src="https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/data-engineering/setup/gcloud-console-vm-price-month.png" width=300>
- You should be good to go and click `CREATE` at the bottom

    <img alt="gcloud-console-vm-create" src="https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/data-engineering/setup/gcloud-console-vm-create.png" width=500>
- It will take a few minutes for your virtual machine (VM) to be created. Your instance will show up like below when ready, with a green circled tick, named `lewagon-data-eng-vm-krokrob` (`krokrob` being replaced by your GitHub username).

    <img alt="gcloud-console-vm-instance-running" src="https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/data-engineering/setup/gcloud-console-vm-instance-running.png" width=500>
- Click on your instance

    <img alt="gcloud-console-vm-running" src="https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/data-engineering/setup/gcloud-console-vm-running.png" width=500>
- Go down to the section `SSH keys`, and write down your username (you need it for the next section)

Congrats, your virtual machine is up and running, it is time to connect it with VS Code!
